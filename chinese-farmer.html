            <h2>The story</h2>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. 
                    They said,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The farmer said,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “<strong>Maybe</strong>.”
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The farmer again said,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “<strong>Maybe</strong>.”
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “Oh dear, that’s too <span class="Bad">bad</span>,” 
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    and the farmer responded,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “<strong>Maybe</strong>.” 
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “Isn’t that great!”
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Again, he said,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “<strong>Maybe</strong>.”
                </blockquote>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="Good">good</span> or <span class="Bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="Good">good</span> fortune.

                    <span class="Good">Good</span> and <span class="Bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="Good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="Good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
